# Shimmer Example Application

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of the Shimmer component to display a shimmer effect while fetching and loading images from Unsplash.

## Deployment

https://shimmer-example-2.vercel.app/

## Description

The ShimmerExample application fetches a random image from the Unsplash API after a 3-second delay to simulate a loading delay. While the image is loading, a shimmer effect is displayed using the Shimmer component from the `react-shimmer-loader` library. Once the image is loaded, it is displayed in place of the shimmer effect.
